## Structure
This is a OpenCode plugin, not a traditional codebase. It consists entirely of markdown files: skill definitions (procedural prompts), entity definitions (semantic references), and templates (frontmatter schemas). The plugin automates Obsidian vault management with 7 entity types following adapted Zettelkasten principles.

## Structural Units
- `skills/` — 6 skill definitions (query, teach, preserve, compress, sync, setup) — the behavioral layer
- `entities/` — 9 entity type definitions (actor, person, team, topic, discussion, project, fleeting, knowledge-node, sources-field) — the semantic layer
- `templates/` — 7 entity templates with frontmatter schemas — the structural layer
- `.opencode/` — plugin manifest (plugin.json)

- `entities/actor.md` — Actor entity definition (systems/services with repos and deployments)
- `entities/fleeting.md` — Fleeting note definition with promotion criteria pipeline
- `entities/knowledge-node.md` — Granular knowledge unit extracted from actor source code

## Dependencies (critical only)
- **OpenCode** — Runtime environment for skill execution
- **Obsidian** — Target vault consumer (humans read via Obsidian, agents write via skills)
- **graphify** (optional) — Semantic code extraction for GitHub repos; used by teach and query skills
- **confluence-to-markdown** (optional) — Confluence page ingestion for teach/sync skills
- **gdoc-to-markdown** (optional) — Google Docs ingestion for teach/sync skills

## Known Issues / Tech Debt
- `entities/knowledge-node.md` is written in Portuguese while all other entity definitions are in English — inconsistency from the genericization effort
- `skills/sync/SKILL.md` at 1,056 lines combines 3 distinct modes (sources, people, github) that could benefit from modular decomposition
- `skill({ name: "compress" })` writes entities directly in Phase 4 rather than fully delegating to `skill({ name: "preserve" })`, breaking the single-write-point pattern
