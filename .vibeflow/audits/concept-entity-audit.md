## Audit Report: concept-entity

**Verdict: PASS**

> Audited on 2026-04-14 against `.vibeflow/specs/concept-entity.md`

### DoD Checklist

- [x] **1. Entity definition exists** — `entities/concept.md` has all 9 sections in order (Entity heading, Source of truth, What it is, When to create, When NOT to create, How to distinguish, Required fields, Zettelkasten Role, Examples). 3 positive examples (event sourcing, circuit breaker, mTLS) and 3 negative examples (temporal migration, actor-specific implementation, vague idea). Exceeds the 2/2 minimum.
- [x] **2. Template exists** — `templates/concepts/_template.md` has YAML frontmatter with inline comments (lines 1-11), Zettelkasten role comment (line 13: `<!-- Zettelkasten role: permanent note -->`), linking instruction comment (line 14), 4 body sections (Description, Key Characteristics, Where it Applies, Related Concepts), and Expected Bidirectional Links table (lines 41-51).
- [x] **3. AGENTS.md updated** — `concept` appears in all 5 required locations:
  - Entity Types table: line 24 (`Concepts | concepts/ | slug.md | event-sourcing.md`)
  - Tags table: line 60 (`concept` in `type/` values)
  - Update Rules table: line 98 (`People, Teams, Concepts, Topics` — append-only)
  - Zettelkasten Principles table: line 144 (`concepts/` in permanent notes)
  - Git commit convention types: line 125 (`concept` in `<type>` values)
- [x] **4. Preserve classification handles concepts** — All 5 required locations updated:
  - Section 1.1 type enum: line 64 (`concept` in type union)
  - Section 1.3 step 4: line 148 (concept classification rule for document/paper nodes, checked before topic fallthrough)
  - Section 1.4 Zettelkasten: line 193 (`concept` classified as permanent)
  - Section 4.1 directory table: line 366 (`concept | concepts/ | slug.md | name`)
  - Section 4.1.1 linking rules: line 396 (`concepts` added to permanent notes list)
  - Bonus: relations block (line 72), free-form extraction (line 91), update rules (line 420), commit types (line 514), graphify metadata (line 175)
- [x] **5. Disambiguation is clear** — "How to distinguish" table has 4 rows:
  - Concept vs Topic (line 29): timeless/definitional vs temporal/lifecycle
  - Concept vs Knowledge-node (line 30): actor-independent vs actor-specific sub-entity
  - Concept vs Fleeting (line 31): self-contained vs raw/unconfirmed
  - Concept vs Actor (line 32): abstract knowledge vs deployed system (bonus row)
- [x] **6. No conventions.md violations** — Verified:
  - Hierarchical tags: `[type/concept]` in template (line 10) and entity def (line 46)
  - Bare wikilinks: `[[entity-name]]`, `[[billing-api]]` etc — no path-qualified links
  - Kebab-case filenames: `concept.md`, `_template.md`, `slug.md` pattern
  - English keys in frontmatter: `type`, `name`, `aliases`, `description`, `related_to`, `sources`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`, `tags`
  - No flat tags anywhere

### Pattern Compliance

- [x] `patterns/entity-definition.md` — Followed exactly. 9 sections in prescribed order. Positive/negative examples with numbered explanations. Distinction table with disambiguation rows. Completeness criteria defined.
- [x] `patterns/template-structure.md` — Followed. YAML frontmatter with inline comments for valid values. `<!-- Zettelkasten role: permanent note -->` HTML comment. `<!-- Links in the body must have context... -->` linking comment. Expected Bidirectional Links reference table marked as removable.
- [x] `patterns/vault-writing-rules.md` — Followed. Hierarchical tags, bare wikilinks, English keys, kebab-case filenames, min 1 alias annotation, `updated_at`/`updated_by` required, `sources` field included.
- [x] `patterns/skill-delegation.md` — Followed. Concept uses the same structured input contract (`type: concept`), same relations block (`concepts: [...]`), same delegation flow through preserve. No direct writes outside preserve.

### Convention Violations

None found.

### Tests

No test runner detected (markdown-only plugin — no build system, no tests, no deployable artifacts). Verified structurally via pattern and convention compliance.
