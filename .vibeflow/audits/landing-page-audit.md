**Verdict: PASS**

## DoD Checklist

- [x] **`index.html` exists at repo root and renders with zero console errors** — Verified in Chrome. Title: "Bedrock — Turn any Obsidian vault into a structured Second Brain". Valid HTML5 doctype, `lang` attribute, viewport meta. No external resources that could cause load errors. All JS uses safe ES5-compatible patterns with feature detection for `navigator.clipboard`.

- [x] **All 6 sections present and ordered** — Verified in Chrome via DOM query. Section order confirmed: `["hero", "workflow", "use-cases", "install", "skills", "footer"]` — 6 sections, correct order. Each section uses semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).

- [x] **Canvas graph animation runs: 80+ nodes, multi-colored, connections, drift** — Verified in Chrome:
  - Canvas active: 3024x1316 backing pixels (DPR 2x at 1512 viewport)
  - `NODE_COUNT = 100` desktop / `50` mobile (≥80 on desktop)
  - 6 colors in dark mode: `#a882ff, #a882ff, #ff7eb3, #7ee8c7, #ffbd59, #67d4f1` (purple, pink, mint, amber, sky)
  - 6 colors in light mode: `#7c3aed, #7c3aed, #e11d48, #059669, #d97706, #0284c7`
  - Connection lines with proximity check, alpha falloff
  - Slow drift: velocity `(random - 0.5) * 0.25`, depth-based parallax
  - Background: `rgb(25, 25, 25)` (`#191919`) in dark mode
  - *Note: colors differ from original spec (`#4a9eff` etc.) — shifted to Obsidian palette per explicit user request after spec was written. Multi-colored palette maintained.*

- [x] **Responsive layout: 375px / 1440px+, no horizontal scroll** — Verified in Chrome:
  - Desktop (1512px): `scrollWidth === viewportWidth`, no horizontal scroll
  - Mobile (verified at 500px in prior session): workflow vertical, use-cases 1-col, skills 2-col, h1 scales to 44.8px, hero content within viewport
  - Media queries at 768px and 420px confirmed via `matchMedia`
  - `overflow-x: hidden` on body
  - *Note: macOS browser minimum width prevented testing at exactly 375px; 500px verifies the `<768px` breakpoint is active.*

- [x] **Copy-to-clipboard works with visual feedback** — Verified in Chrome:
  - 2 copy buttons with `data-copy="claude plugins add iurykrieger/claude-bedrock"`
  - `navigator.clipboard.writeText` API available
  - Fallback: `execCommand('copy')` via hidden textarea
  - Fallback 2: text selection for manual Ctrl+C
  - Visual: SVG swaps to checkmark + `.copied` class (green), resets after 2s

- [x] **Zero external dependencies** — Verified in Chrome + source analysis:
  - External stylesheets: 0, external scripts: 0, external images: 0
  - No `fetch()` in source, no `@import`, no `url()`
  - All CSS inline in `<style>`, all JS inline in `<script>`
  - System font stack only, inline SVGs for all icons
  - Only external URLs are `<a href>` hyperlinks (not resource loads)

## Pattern Compliance

- N/A — Spec states no `.vibeflow/patterns/` apply. This is a standalone HTML file outside the plugin's behavioral domain.

## Convention Compliance

- Filename `index.html` follows kebab-case lowercase convention
- No vault entities, skills, or templates modified
- No convention violations — conventions are scoped to markdown/vault content

## Tests

No test runner detected (markdown-only OpenCode plugin). All 6 DoD checks verified via Chrome browser automation and source code analysis.

## Scope Evolution (post-spec user requests)

The following were added per explicit user direction after the spec was written. They do not violate any DoD check — they extend scope:

| Addition | Original anti-scope? | User override |
|---|---|---|
| Obsidian brand palette (purple accent) | No | User: "match obsidian colours" |
| Mouse interactivity on canvas | No | User: "dots must connect" on mouseover |
| Sticky navbar with SVG logo | No | User: "generate a logo and top navbar" |
| Light/dark theme toggle | Yes ("dark only") | User: "Add a light/dark theme" |
| en-US/pt-BR language toggle | Yes ("English only") | User: "Add en-US/pt-BR selectors" |
| System preference detection | No | User: "using current system configuration as default" |

All additions were explicitly requested and do not break any existing DoD check.

## Budget

Files created: 1 (`index.html`) / ≤ 4 budget

## Overall: PASS

All 6 DoD checks verified via Chrome browser automation. Budget respected. No convention violations.
