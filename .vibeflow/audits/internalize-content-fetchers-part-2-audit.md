# Audit Report: Internalize Content Fetchers — Part 2

**Spec:** `.vibeflow/specs/internalize-content-fetchers-part-2.md`
**Audited:** 2026-04-15

**Verdict: PASS**

## DoD Checklist

- [x] **DoD 1** — `/teach` Phase 1.3.2 (Confluence) reads `fetchers/confluence.md` inline
  - Evidence: `skills/teach/SKILL.md:103` — "Read the internal fetcher module at `<base_dir>/../../fetchers/confluence.md`"
  - No Skill tool invocation of `/confluence-to-markdown` anywhere in the file
  - Steps: parse URL, choose strategy, save to tmp (lines 102-108)

- [x] **DoD 2** — `/teach` Phase 1.3.3 (Google Docs/Sheets) reads `fetchers/gdoc.md` inline
  - Evidence: `skills/teach/SKILL.md:113` — "Read the internal fetcher module at `<base_dir>/../../fetchers/gdoc.md`"
  - No Skill tool invocation of `/gdoc-to-markdown` anywhere in the file
  - Steps: parse URL, detect type, choose strategy, copy output to tmp (lines 112-119)

- [x] **DoD 3** — Strings `/confluence-to-markdown` and `/gdoc-to-markdown` do not appear in teach SKILL.md
  - Evidence: `grep` for both patterns returns 0 matches
  - Classification table (lines 56-57) references internal fetcher files, not external skills
  - Critical Rules table (line 305) explicitly states: "Never invoke external skills for content fetching"
  - Old "Invoke skill" and "skill is not installed" patterns also absent (grep returns 0 matches)

- [x] **DoD 4** — `/setup` Phase 1.2 validates env vars and MCP with clear reporting
  - Evidence: `skills/setup/SKILL.md:99-102` — dependency table with 4 entries:
    - `graphify` via Glob (line 99)
    - `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN + CONFLUENCE_USER_EMAIL` via Bash `test -n` (line 100)
    - `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` via Bash `test -n` (line 101)
    - `claude-in-chrome MCP` via ToolSearch (line 102)
  - Report format includes source availability summary (lines 116-124)
  - Guidance messages for missing env vars: Confluence (lines 138-146), Google (lines 148-157)

- [x] **DoD 5** — `/setup` no longer checks for external skills via Glob
  - Evidence: `grep` for `confluence-to-markdown` and `gdoc-to-markdown` in setup SKILL.md returns 0 matches
  - Only remaining Glob check is for `graphify` (line 99), which is correct — graphify is still an external required dependency

- [x] **DoD 6** — Follows skill-architecture pattern (phased structure, Plugin Paths, Critical Rules preserved)
  - **teach SKILL.md:**
    - YAML frontmatter: preserved (lines 1-12) — name, description, user_invocable, allowed-tools all intact
    - Plugin Paths: preserved (lines 16-25)
    - Overview: preserved (lines 29-44)
    - Phased structure: Phase 1 (line 48), Phase 2 (line 164), Phase 3 (line 210), Phase 4 (line 241) — all present and in order
    - Critical Rules table: preserved and extended (lines 295-309) — 11 rules including new "Internal fetcher modules" rule
  - **setup SKILL.md:**
    - YAML frontmatter: preserved (lines 1-11) — name, description, user_invocable, allowed-tools all intact
    - Phased structure: Phase 1 (unchanged), Phase 2+ (untouched at line 163+)
    - Critical Rules table: preserved at line 1069

## Pattern Compliance

- [x] **skill-architecture.md** — Both skills maintain the required structure: YAML frontmatter → Plugin Paths → Overview → numbered Phases → Critical Rules table. The teach SKILL.md Critical Rules table was extended with one new rule (line 305) following the existing `| Rule | Detail |` format. No structural deviations.

- [x] **skill-delegation.md** — The delegation chain (`/teach` → `/preserve`) is completely unchanged. Phase 3 "Delegate to skill({ name: "preserve" })" (lines 210-238) was not modified. Fetcher modules are a Phase 1 implementation detail that feeds into the unchanged pipeline.

## Convention Violations

None found.

- Naming: all kebab-case, lowercase filenames
- No flat tags, no path-qualified wikilinks
- No sensitive data embedded (env var references only, never values)
- "Do NOT write entities directly from detection skills" — respected, teach still delegates to preserve
- "Do NOT block workflows for failed external sources" — respected, fetcher abort is per-source-type, not workflow-blocking
- "Do NOT use subagents for MCP calls" — preserved in Critical Rules (line 307)

## Tests

No test runner detected (markdown-only OpenCode plugin). Verify manually that the implementation works.

## Anti-scope Verification

- [x] NOT modifying fetcher modules — `fetchers/confluence.md`, `fetchers/gdoc.md`, `fetchers/scripts/extract.js` were not touched
- [x] NOT changing Phase 2/3/4 of teach — Phases 2 (line 164), 3 (line 210), 4 (line 241) are identical to pre-implementation
- [x] NOT adding new source types — classification table still has the same 8 source types
- [x] NOT changing allowed-tools frontmatter — `allowed-tools` line identical in both files
- [x] NOT adding env var validation to teach — strategy selection lives in fetcher modules, teach just reads and follows them
