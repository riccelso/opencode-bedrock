## DoD Checklist

- [x] **Check 1 — All 5 checks implemented**
  Evidence: Phase 2 contains all 5 checks with complete detection logic:
  - Check 1 (graphify-out): `SKILL.md:94-145` — directory existence, graph.json existence, JSON validity, node counts, staleness (>30d)
  - Check 2 (setup): `SKILL.md:147-185` — 8 entity directories, _template.md per directory, entity definitions in plugin dir, plugin.json validity
  - Check 3 (orphans): `SKILL.md:187-205` — inbound wikilink count per entity, alias matching, 0-inbound = orphan
  - Check 4 (dangling): `SKILL.md:207-220` — orphan + no outbound wikilinks + no frontmatter relations = dangling (strict subset)
  - Check 5 (old content): `SKILL.md:222-236` — updated_at parsing, 15-day threshold, sorted oldest-first

- [x] **Check 2 — Strictly read-only tools**
  Evidence: `SKILL.md:10` declares `allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Glob, Grep`. No Write, Edit, Skill, or Agent. Critical Rules table at `SKILL.md:324` reinforces: "NEVER use Write, Edit, Skill, or Agent tools." The tool restriction is enforced at both the declaration level (OpenCode won't offer the tools) and the instruction level (rules explicitly forbid them).

- [x] **Check 3 — Follows skill architecture pattern**
  Evidence:
  - YAML frontmatter at `SKILL.md:1-11`: `name`, `description`, `user_invocable`, `allowed-tools` all present
  - Plugin Paths section at `SKILL.md:15-24`: standard boilerplate
  - Overview with agent type at `SKILL.md:33`: "You are a read-only agent." (first read-only skill in the plugin)
  - Numbered phases: Phase 1 (scan), Phase 2 (checks), Phase 3 (report) — sequential
  - Critical Rules table at `SKILL.md:320-333`: 10 rules in `| Rule | Detail |` format
  - No Phase 0 (git pull): justified — this is a read-only skill, not a write skill. The pattern specifies Phase 0 for write skills only.

- [x] **Check 4 — AGENTS.md skills table updated**
  Evidence: `AGENTS.md:113` contains: `skill({ name: "healthcheck" })` | Read-only vault health diagnostic — checks graphify-out integrity, setup, orphan entities, dangling content, old content (>15 days). Safe to run at any frequency`. Description accurately matches the 5 checks and read-only nature.

- [x] **Check 5 — No mutation logic**
  Evidence:
  - No git commands anywhere in the skill (Critical Rules `SKILL.md:325`: "NEVER run git add, commit, push, pull")
  - No Skill tool in allowed-tools → cannot invoke skill({ name: "compress" }), /teach, /preserve
  - Phase 3 suggestions at `SKILL.md:297-303` are all text strings ("Run `skill({ name: "compress" })`..."), not tool invocations
  - No Phase 0 (vault sync via git pull) — skill starts directly with Phase 1 (scan)
  - No Write/Edit in allowed-tools → cannot modify any file

## Pattern Compliance

- [x] **`patterns/skill-architecture.md`** — Followed correctly.
  - YAML frontmatter with all 4 required fields (`SKILL.md:1-11`)
  - Plugin Paths boilerplate (`SKILL.md:15-24`)
  - Overview with agent type declaration: "read-only agent" (`SKILL.md:33`)
  - Sequential phase numbering 1-3, sub-phases with decimal (1.1, 1.2, 2.1...)
  - Critical Rules table at the end (`SKILL.md:320-333`)
  - **Justified deviation:** No Phase 0 (git pull). Pattern says "Phase 0 is always git pull for write skills." Healthcheck is read-only — no vault sync needed. Correct behavior.

- [x] **`patterns/entity-definition.md`** — Followed correctly.
  - Phase 1.1 (`SKILL.md:59-66`) enumerates all 8 entity directories including actor sub-structures
  - Templates excluded via Glob filter (`SKILL.md:63`) and Critical Rules (`SKILL.md:329`)
  - Entity definitions checked in Phase 2.2.2 (`SKILL.md:160-169`) against expected list

- [x] **`patterns/vault-writing-rules.md`** — Followed correctly.
  - Wikilink parsing uses bare names `[[name]]` (`SKILL.md:80`, Critical Rules `SKILL.md:332`)
  - Writing rules are N/A since this skill never writes — no risk of violation
  - The pattern's backlink expectation ("if A links to B, B should link back") is what Check 3 (orphans) implicitly validates by checking inbound links

## Convention Violations

None found. Verified against `.vibeflow/conventions.md`:
- Skill name matches directory: `healthcheck` ✓
- Heading format: `# skill({ name: "healthcheck" }) — Vault Health Report` ✓
- Skill structure order: frontmatter → heading → Plugin Paths → Overview → Phases → Critical Rules ✓
- Don'ts: no flat tags, no path-qualified wikilinks, no direct writes, skill never invokes other skills ✓

## Tests

No test runner detected (markdown-only OpenCode plugin). Verify manually.

## Summary

All 5 DoD checks pass. All 3 applicable patterns followed (1 justified deviation: no Phase 0 for read-only skill). No convention violations. Budget: 2/4 files. This is the first read-only skill in the Bedrock plugin, establishing a new pattern for diagnostic tools that don't modify the vault.
