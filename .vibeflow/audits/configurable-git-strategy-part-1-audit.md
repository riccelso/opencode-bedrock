# Audit Report: Configurable Git Strategy — Part 1

**Verdict: PASS**

> Audited: 2026-04-15
> Spec: `.vibeflow/specs/configurable-git-strategy-part-1.md`

## DoD Checklist

- [x] **1. Config schema expanded** — `skills/setup/SKILL.md:455-466` adds `"git": { "strategy": "<GIT_STRATEGY>" }` to the config JSON schema. Field definition at line 474 documents valid values (`"commit-push"`, `"commit-push-pr"`, `"commit-only"`).
- [x] **2. Default is backwards-compatible** — `skills/preserve/SKILL.md:548` explicitly states: "If the file does not exist or has no `git` key, default to `commit-push`". The `commit-push` strategy block (lines 554-568) replicates the original trunk-based workflow identically (commit, push main, rebase retry, 2x max, no-remote fallback).
- [x] **3. `commit-push-pr` works in preserve** — `skills/preserve/SKILL.md:572-613` implements the full flow: `gh` availability check with fallback (line 580), branch naming with date+slug convention (lines 586-587), collision detection via `git branch --list` (lines 589-593), branch creation, commit, push, `gh pr create` with commit message as title (line 607), return to main (line 612).
- [x] **4. `commit-only` works in preserve** — `skills/preserve/SKILL.md:617-626` commits locally and outputs the informational message. No push logic, no rebase retry.
- [x] **5. Setup offers strategy selection** — `skills/setup/SKILL.md:367-398` (Phase 2.4) presents 3 options with default. Checks `gh` availability for `commit-push-pr` with non-blocking warning. Idempotency display shows current strategy (line 56). Reconfigure description updated to mention "git strategy" (line 62).
- [x] **6. No conventions.md violations** — No flat tags, no path-qualified wikilinks, no direct entity writes from detection skills. Skill structure preserved (Plugin Paths, sequential phases, Critical Rules table intact in both files).

## Pattern Compliance

- [x] **skill-architecture** — Both skills maintain: YAML frontmatter, Plugin Paths section, sequential phase numbering, sub-phases with decimal notation (2.4, 6.2.1-6.2.3), Critical Rules table at end. Phase 0 remains `git pull --rebase` for preserve.
  - Evidence: `skills/preserve/SKILL.md:16` (Plugin Paths), `skills/preserve/SKILL.md:668` (Critical Rules), `skills/setup/SKILL.md:16` (Plugin Paths), `skills/setup/SKILL.md:1084` (Critical Rules).
- [x] **vault-writing-rules** — Git convention (commit message format) unchanged. Strategy dispatch is additive — does not modify the commit message convention itself. AGENTS.md documentation update is explicitly deferred to Part 2 (correctly in anti-scope).
- [x] **skill-delegation** — Preserve remains the single write point. Git phase is self-contained within Phase 6. No other skills modified (compress/sync correctly deferred to Part 2).

## Convention Violations

None found.

## Notes

- Phase numbering fix applied during audit: original implementation used `### 2.3 Git Strategy Selection` which collided with existing `### 2.3 Custom Preset`. Corrected to `### 2.4`. This was caught and fixed during the audit pass.
- Budget: 2 files modified out of ≤ 4 budget.
- Anti-scope fully respected: no changes to compress, sync, AGENTS.md, or any excluded features.
- No test runner available (markdown-only plugin). Manual verification recommended.
