# Audit Report: Multiple Vaults — Part 1

> Spec: `.vibeflow/specs/multiple-vaults-part-1.md`
> Audited: 2026-04-15

**Verdict: PASS**

## DoD Checklist

- [x] **1. Registry file created on first use** — `setup/SKILL.md:1049-1066` Phase 3.7 Steps 1-2 resolve `<base_dir>/../../vaults.json`, create empty registry if not found. Step 6 (line 1091) appends the vault entry and writes the file.
- [x] **2. Setup prompts for vault name** — `setup/SKILL.md:1073-1081` Step 4 prompts with CWD basename as default, validates kebab-case and uniqueness. Step 5 (line 1083-1089) handles default: auto-default if first vault, asks user if others exist.
- [x] **3. Vaults skill lists registered vaults** — `vaults/SKILL.md:89-119` Phase 2.1 presents table with Name, Path, Default (`*`), and Status columns. Validates disk existence per vault. Flags missing paths with remediation guidance.
- [x] **4. Vaults skill sets default** — `vaults/SKILL.md:121-129` Phase 2.2 validates name against registry, sets all vaults to `"default": false`, marks target as `true`, writes back.
- [x] **5. Vaults skill removes a vault** — `vaults/SKILL.md:131-139` Phase 2.3 validates name, removes entry, handles default reassignment to first remaining vault if needed. Explicitly confirms "Files on disk were NOT deleted."
- [x] **6. No violations of conventions.md** — Vaults skill follows skill-architecture pattern: YAML frontmatter (lines 1-12), Plugin Paths (16-24), Overview with agent type "management agent" (28-35), Phases 0-3 (39-157), Critical Rules table (160-171). No flat tags, no path-qualified wikilinks, kebab-case enforced.
- [x] **7. Backward compatible** — `setup/SKILL.md:60-76` Phase 0 checks registry for existing vaults, displays registration status. Offers 3 options: Reconfigure (runs Phase 3.7), Register only (skips to Phase 3.7), Skip. Phase 3.7 Step 3 (line 1068-1071) gracefully handles already-registered vaults.

## Pattern Compliance

- [x] **Skill Architecture** (`patterns/skill-architecture.md`) — `vaults/SKILL.md` has all 5 required sections: YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `user_invocable`, `allowed-tools`; Plugin Paths section; Overview with agent type; numbered Phases (0-3); Critical Rules table. Phase 0 is input parsing (not git pull — correctly follows "Phase 0 is git pull for write skills" convention since this is a read-only management skill).
- [x] **Vault Writing Rules** (`patterns/vault-writing-rules.md`) — Kebab-case naming enforced in vault name validation (setup Phase 3.7 Step 4). No entity writes or git operations in the vaults skill. No flat tags or path-qualified wikilinks introduced.

## Convention Violations

None found.

## Tests

No test runner detected (markdown-only OpenCode plugin — no build system, no tests, no deployable artifacts). This is expected per `index.md` project type: "library (OpenCode plugin for Obsidian vault automation)."

## Budget

Files changed: 3 / ≤ 4 budget
- `skills/vaults/SKILL.md` — created (new skill)
- `skills/setup/SKILL.md` — edited (Phase 0 + Phase 3.7 + Phase 4 + Critical Rules)
- `AGENTS.md` — edited (Skills table + Vault Resolution section)

## Notes

- The Vault Resolution section in AGENTS.md documents the full 4-step precedence chain (explicit flag > CWD detection > default vault > error), but the actual resolution logic inside skills is deferred to Parts 2 and 3. This is correct — Part 1 establishes documentation and infrastructure.
- The plugin reinstall warning in AGENTS.md addresses the risk identified in the spec (registry loss on reinstall).
