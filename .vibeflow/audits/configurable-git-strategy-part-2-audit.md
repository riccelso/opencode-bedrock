# Audit Report: Configurable Git Strategy — Part 2

**Verdict: PASS**

> Audited: 2026-04-15
> Spec: `.vibeflow/specs/configurable-git-strategy-part-2.md`

## DoD Checklist

- [x] **1. Compress reads config** — `skills/compress/SKILL.md:399-495` — Phase 5.2 reads `.bedrock/config.json`, Phase 5.3 dispatches to all 3 strategies with identical structure to preserve. Branch naming uses `vault/<date>-compress-<N>-entities`. PR body: "Automated by skill({ name: "compress" })".
- [x] **2. Sync reads config** — Two git phases updated:
  - Phase 5.4 (`skills/sync/SKILL.md:908-998`): watermark commit. Branch: `vault/<date>-sync-github-<N>-actors`.
  - Phase 6.3 (`skills/sync/SKILL.md:1097-1187`): report commit. Branch: `vault/<date>-sync-github-report`.
  Both read config and dispatch identically.
- [x] **3. Fallback works** — All dispatch blocks default to `"commit-push"` when config is absent or lacks `git` key. Evidence: compress line 407, sync lines 916 and 1105.
- [x] **4. AGENTS.md updated** — `AGENTS.md:117-145` — Strategy table with 3 options, backwards-compat note ("all skills default to `commit-push`"), branch naming convention, preserved commit convention and examples.
- [x] **5. Consistent strategy description** — Verified structural consistency across all 4 dispatch blocks (preserve 6.2, compress 5.3, sync 5.4, sync 6.3):
  - Same config read pattern (`cat .bedrock/config.json 2>/dev/null`)
  - Same default and valid values
  - Same `commit-push` flow (commit, push main, rebase retry)
  - Same `commit-push-pr` flow (`gh` check → fallback → branch create → collision check → commit → push → PR → return main)
  - Same `commit-only` flow (commit, no push, informational output)
  - Per-skill variations are appropriate: branch slug and PR body attribution differ by skill name.

## Pattern Compliance

- [x] **skill-architecture** — Both skills maintain Plugin Paths, sequential phase numbering (compress: 5.1→5.2→5.3→5.4; sync phases preserved), and end-of-file tables (compress: Error Handling at line 529; sync: Critical Rules at line 1207).
- [x] **vault-writing-rules** — AGENTS.md Git Workflow section updated. Commit message convention preserved unchanged. The "trunk-based" statement is replaced with strategy table; `commit-push` default is documented.
- [x] **skill-delegation** — Compress git phase remains within its own Phase 5 (separate from preserve delegation). Sync git phases (5.4, 6.3) remain in their existing locations. No changes to delegation flow.

## Convention Violations

None found.

## Notes

- Implementation correctly identified and updated TWO git commit/push blocks in sync (Phase 5.4 and Phase 6.3), even though the spec only explicitly mentioned Phase 5.4. This was the right call — Phase 6.3 also hardcoded push-to-main.
- Phase sub-numbering in compress was correctly adjusted: old 5.1/5.2/5.3 became 5.1/5.2/5.3/5.4 with no collisions.
- Budget: 3 files modified out of ≤ 4 budget.
- Anti-scope fully respected: no changes to preserve or setup (Part 1 territory).
- No test runner available (markdown-only plugin). Manual verification recommended.
