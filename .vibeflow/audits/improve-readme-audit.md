## Audit Report: improve-readme

**Verdict: PASS**

### DoD Checklist
- [x] Banner image displayed at top of README via `docs/banner.png` — `docs/banner.png` exists (1498x1484 PNG, 687KB), referenced at `README.md:2` as `<img src="docs/banner.png" alt="Bedrock — Knowledge graph visualization" width="600">`
- [x] README includes all required sections — value proposition (line 19-21), features (lines 23-31, 7 bullets), installation (lines 33-43), skills table (lines 63-71, 6 skills), vault structure (lines 73-86), how it works (lines 88-99), contributing guide (lines 113-144), license (line 148)
- [x] Tone is welcoming to open-source contributors — "Contributions are welcome!" (line 115), clear fork/branch/PR workflow (lines 116-125), project structure explained (lines 127-144)
- [x] No broken image references or links — `docs/banner.png` verified as valid PNG, badge URLs use standard shields.io service, external links to docs.anthropic.com and zettelkasten.de are well-known stable URLs

### Pattern Compliance
- [x] File naming convention — `docs/banner.png` follows kebab-case lowercase convention
- [x] Markdown-only project — no build artifacts, dependencies, or runtime files introduced
- [x] Anti-scope respected — `git diff` confirms zero changes to AGENTS.md, skills/, entities/, templates/, .opencode/plugin.json; no CI/CD config added; no LICENSE file created

### Convention Violations
None.

### Budget
Files changed: 2 / 2 budget (README.md modified, docs/banner.png added)

### Tests
No test runner detected (markdown-only OpenCode plugin). Manual verification performed: banner image valid, all sections present, anti-scope respected.

### Notes
- README grew from 92 lines to 148 lines (+61%) with significantly more structure for open-source consumers
- Added: badges, features list, how-it-works flow, optional dependencies table, contributing guide with project structure
- Preserved: installation commands, skills table, vault structure tree from original README
