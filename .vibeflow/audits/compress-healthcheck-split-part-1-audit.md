## DoD Checklist

- [x] **Check 1 — All 5 capabilities with detection + fix logic**
  Evidence: Phase 1 contains explicit detection algorithms per capability:
  - Capability 1 (broken backlinks): detection at `SKILL.md:113-121`, fix at `SKILL.md:372-386`
  - Capability 2 (concept match): detection at `SKILL.md:123-141`, fix at `SKILL.md:388-410`
  - Capability 3 (entity misalignment): detection at `SKILL.md:143-162`, fix at `SKILL.md:412-456`
  - Capability 4 (duplicated entities): detection at `SKILL.md:164-181`, fix at `SKILL.md:458-480`
  - Capability 5 (misnamed entities): detection at `SKILL.md:183-195`, fix at `SKILL.md:482-529`
  Each capability has structured output format, detection heuristics, filter criteria, and YAML delegation payloads.

- [x] **Check 2 — Tiered autonomy model**
  Evidence: Overview table at `SKILL.md:49-55` classifies each capability as Mechanical/Semantic. Phase 3 (`SKILL.md:303-362`) implements the split: interactive mode requires confirmation for all 5; cron mode auto-executes caps 1,4 and queues caps 2,3,5 as a fleeting note (`fleeting/YYYY-MM-DD-compress-proposals.md`). Critical rules at `SKILL.md:59-60` explicitly forbid autonomous execution of semantic capabilities.

- [x] **Check 3 — All writes via skill({ name: "preserve" })**
  Evidence: `allowed-tools` at `SKILL.md:11` is `Bash, Read, Glob, Grep, Skill, Agent` — no Write or Edit. Phase 4.2 at `SKILL.md:531-538` delegates via Skill tool. Critical rules table row 1 at `SKILL.md:614`: "NEVER use Write or Edit on entity files." Overview rule at `SKILL.md:58` reinforces.

- [x] **Check 4 — Follows skill architecture pattern**
  Evidence:
  - YAML frontmatter at `SKILL.md:1-12`: `name`, `description`, `user_invocable`, `allowed-tools` all present
  - Plugin Paths section at `SKILL.md:16-25`: standard boilerplate
  - Overview with agent type at `SKILL.md:34`: "You are an execution agent."
  - Numbered phases: 0 (git pull), 1 (scan), 2 (proposal), 3 (confirmation), 4 (delegation), 5 (report)
  - Critical Rules table at `SKILL.md:610-624`: 11 rules in `| Rule | Detail |` format

- [x] **Check 5 — AGENTS.md skills table updated**
  Evidence: `AGENTS.md:112` now reads: "Vault alignment engine — fixes broken backlinks, concept fragmentation, entity miscategorization, duplicated entities, misnamed entities. Supports `--mode cron` for scheduled execution". Old description ("Deduplication and vault health") replaced.

- [x] **Check 6 — No health reporting logic remains**
  Evidence: Grep for `orphan|stale|health.report|dangling|graph.integrity` across `SKILL.md` returns only line 587: a suggestion to run `skill({ name: "healthcheck" })` (text reference, not logic). No Phase 1.5 (graph integrity), no Phase 4.2 (health report), no orphan/stale/dangling detection algorithms exist.

## Pattern Compliance

- [x] **`patterns/skill-architecture.md`** — Followed correctly.
  - YAML frontmatter with all 4 required fields (`SKILL.md:1-12`)
  - Plugin Paths boilerplate (`SKILL.md:16-25`)
  - Overview with agent type declaration (`SKILL.md:34`)
  - Sequential phase numbering 0-5, sub-phases with decimal (1.0, 1.1...)
  - Critical Rules table at the end (`SKILL.md:610-624`)
  - Phase 0 is `git pull --rebase origin main` (write skill convention)

- [x] **`patterns/skill-delegation.md`** — Followed correctly.
  - All writes through `skill({ name: "preserve" })` via Skill tool (`SKILL.md:531-538`)
  - Structured entity list format matches the contract: `type`, `name`, `action`, `content`, `relations`, `source` (`SKILL.md:374-529`)
  - Provenance: `source: "compress"` for all delegated entities (`SKILL.md:622`)
  - User confirmation before delegation in interactive mode (`SKILL.md:305-319`)
  - Cron mode passes "Autonomous mode" prompt to preserve (`SKILL.md:327-328`)

- [x] **`patterns/entity-definition.md`** — Followed correctly.
  - Phase 1.0 (`SKILL.md:85-92`) reads entity definitions at runtime from plugin directory
  - Capability 2 validates against `entities/concept.md` "When to create"/"When NOT to create" (`SKILL.md:130-134`)
  - Capability 3 evaluates against entity definitions for misalignment detection (`SKILL.md:147-155`)

- [x] **`patterns/vault-writing-rules.md`** — Followed correctly.
  - Backlink rules: Capability 1 detects/fixes missing bidirectional links (`SKILL.md:113-121`)
  - Append-only: Critical rule at `SKILL.md:617` and overview rule at `SKILL.md:63`
  - Free merge for actors: Critical rule at `SKILL.md:618` and overview rule at `SKILL.md:64`
  - Never remove wikilinks: Critical rule at `SKILL.md:619` and overview rule at `SKILL.md:61`
  - Wikilink format: All examples use bare names `[[entity-name]]` — no path-qualified or display names

## Convention Violations

None found. Verified against `.vibeflow/conventions.md`:
- Skill name matches directory: `compress` ✓
- Heading format: `# skill({ name: "compress" })` ✓
- Skill structure order: frontmatter → heading → Plugin Paths → Overview → Phases → Critical Rules ✓
- Don'ts: no flat tags, no path-qualified wikilinks, no direct writes, no MCP in subagents ✓

## Tests

No test runner detected (markdown-only OpenCode plugin). Verify manually.

## Summary

All 6 DoD checks pass. All 4 applicable patterns followed. No convention violations. Budget: 2/4 files. The implementation is a complete rewrite of the compress skill with clean separation of concerns (no health reporting) and proper delegation to `skill({ name: "preserve" })`.
