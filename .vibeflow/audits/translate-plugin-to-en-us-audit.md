# Audit Report: Translate Plugin to en-US

**Verdict: PASS**

**Spec:** `.vibeflow/prompt-packs/translate-plugin-to-en-us.md`
**Date:** 2026-04-13
**Files changed:** ~24 (6 skills + 7 templates + 9 entities + 2 docs)

---

## DoD Checklist

- [x] **Check 1 — All 6 skill files in English** — All frontmatter descriptions, section headers (Phase N format), instructions, error messages, report templates, and Critical Rules tables are in English. Zero Portuguese words found via grep across all 6 files. Git commit templates use `[source: ...]` (not `[fonte: ...]`). Commit convention types use English (`person`, `actor`, `team`, etc.).

- [x] **Check 2 — All 7 template files in English** — All HTML comments translated (`<!-- Zettelkasten role: ... -->`, `<!-- Links in the body... -->`). All section headers translated (Context, Participants, Conclusions, Action Items, Focal Points, Active Topics, etc.). YAML inline comments translated. "Expected Bidirectional Links" reference tables preserved. Minor fix applied during audit: `Deprecacao` → `Deprecation` in topics template alias example, `SIGLA` → `Acronym` in projects template, `(ex:` → `(e.g.,` in projects/teams/topics templates.

- [x] **Check 3 — All 9 entity definition files in English** — All section headers follow English convention (What it is, When to create, When NOT to create, How to distinguish, Required fields, Zettelkasten Role, Completeness Criteria, Examples). Field description tables in English. Example scenarios in English. Zero Portuguese words found via grep.

- [x] **Check 4 — AGENTS.md fully in English** — Git convention types: `person`, `team`, `actor`, `topic`, `discussion`, `project`, `note` (line 124). Verbs: `creates`, `updates`, `links`, `compresses` (line 125). Uses `[source: <origin>]` (line 120). Language rule: "English (en-US) for all content by default" (line 38). Frontmatter example: `description: "Billing and invoicing API"` (line 44). Scope parentheticals: `hipaa` (health), `gdpr` (Europe). Zettelkasten reference updated to "Zettelkasten Role".

- [x] **Check 5 — README.md language rule updated** — Writing Rules section: "English (en-US) by default (configurable via `skill({ name: "setup" })`)" (line 80). Git convention: `[source: <origin>]` (line 85). No remaining Portuguese content.

---

## Pattern Compliance

- [x] **skill-architecture** — All skills retain required structure: YAML frontmatter → heading → Plugin Paths → Overview → Phases → Critical Rules. Phase naming updated from `Fase N` to `Phase N` consistently. Agent type declarations translated ("You are an execution agent").

- [x] **entity-definition** — All entity definitions retain required sections: heading → source-of-truth reference → What/When/When NOT/Distinguish/Required fields/Zettelkasten Role/Examples. Section order preserved. Classification tables preserved.

- [x] **template-structure** — All templates retain: YAML frontmatter with inline comments → Zettelkasten role comment → linking instruction comment → body sections → Expected Bidirectional Links table. Frontmatter keys unchanged.

- [x] **vault-writing-rules** — AGENTS.md and skills now reference configurable vault language (not hardcoded pt-BR). Commit convention fully translated. Tag hierarchy unchanged. Wikilink rules unchanged.

- [x] **skill-delegation** — Delegation pattern preserved: teach → preserve, sync → preserve. No structural changes to skill logic.

---

## Convention Violations

- **`.vibeflow/conventions.md` is stale** — Still references Portuguese git convention (`pessoa`, `cria`, `[fonte: ...]`). This is in `.vibeflow/` (anti-scope for this task), but should be updated separately to match the new English conventions in AGENTS.md.

---

## Anti-scope Compliance

- [x] `.vibeflow/` directory — not modified (verified via grep; Portuguese remnants exist but are anti-scope)
- [x] `plugin.json` — not modified
- [x] `.claude/` directory — not modified
- [x] File/directory names — unchanged
- [x] YAML frontmatter keys — preserved in English (type, name, status, updated_at, etc.)
- [x] Code blocks and bash commands — preserved as-is
- [x] Wikilink syntax — preserved (verified: templates retain 15+ wikilinks each)
- [x] Skill names and technical terms — preserved

---

## Tests

No test runner detected — markdown-only project. Verification performed via:
1. Grep for common Portuguese words across entities/, templates/, skills/, AGENTS.md, README.md → zero matches
2. YAML frontmatter integrity check → all 13 skill+template files valid
3. Wikilink preservation check → all templates retain references
4. `pt-BR` reference check → only legitimate occurrences in setup skill (language option)

---

## Summary

All 5 DoD checks pass. Translation is comprehensive across 24 files. Three minor Portuguese remnants were caught and fixed during this audit (template alias examples and abbreviation style). The `.vibeflow/conventions.md` is now stale relative to the new English git conventions but is out of scope for this task.
