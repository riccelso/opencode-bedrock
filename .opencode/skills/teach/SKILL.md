# bedrock-teach — External Source Ingestion into the Second Brain

## Plugin Paths

Entity definitions and templates are in the plugin directory, not at the vault root.
Use the "Base directory for this skill" provided at invocation to resolve paths:

- Entity definitions: `<base_dir>/../../entities/`
- Templates: `<base_dir>/../../templates/{type}/_template.md`
- Plugin AGENTS.md: `<base_dir>/../../AGENTS.md` (already injected automatically into context)

Where `<base_dir>` is the path provided in "Base directory for this skill".

---

## Vault Resolution

Resolve which vault to teach. This skill can be invoked from any directory.

**Step 1 — Parse `--vault` flag:**
Check if the input arguments include `--vault <name>`. If found, extract the vault name and remove it from the arguments (the remaining text is the source URL/path).

**Step 2 — Resolve vault path:**

1. **If `--vault <name>` was provided:**
   Read the vault registry at `<base_dir>/../../vaults.json`. Find the entry matching the name.
   If not found: error — "Vault `<name>` is not registered. Run `skill({ name: "vaults" })` to see available vaults."
   If found: set `VAULT_PATH` to the entry's `path` value. Store the resolved vault name as `VAULT_NAME`.

2. **If no `--vault` flag — CWD detection:**
   Read `<base_dir>/../../vaults.json`. Check if the current working directory is inside any registered vault path
   (CWD starts with a registered vault's absolute path). If multiple match, use the longest path (most specific).
   If found: set `VAULT_PATH` to the matching vault's `path`. Store its name as `VAULT_NAME`.

3. **If CWD detection fails — default vault:**
   From the registry, find the vault with `"default": true`.
   If found: set `VAULT_PATH` to the default vault's `path`. Store its name as `VAULT_NAME`.

4. **If no resolution:**
   Error — "No vault resolved. Available vaults:" followed by the registry listing.
   "Use `--vault <name>` to specify, or run `skill({ name: "setup" })` to register a vault."

**Step 3 — Validate vault path:**
```bash
test -d "<VAULT_PATH>" && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
```
If missing: error — "Vault path `<VAULT_PATH>` does not exist on disk. Run `skill({ name: "setup" })` to re-register."

**Step 4 — Read vault config:**
```bash
cat <VAULT_PATH>/.bedrock/config.json 2>/dev/null
```
Extract `language` and other relevant fields for use in later phases.

**From this point forward, ALL vault file operations use `<VAULT_PATH>` as the root.**
- Graphify output: `<VAULT_PATH>/graphify-out/`
- When delegating to `skill({ name: "preserve" })`, pass `--vault <VAULT_NAME>`

---

## Overview

This skill receives an external source (URL or local path), fetches its content to a temporary
directory, converts non-markdown files to markdown via docling, runs the `skill({ name: "graphify" })` extraction
pipeline on the tmp content, and delegates entity persistence (plus graphify-output merge) to
`skill({ name: "preserve" })`.

**You are a fetcher and orchestrator agent.** Your job is to:
1. Ensure docling is installed (auto-install if missing)
2. Classify the input and fetch content to `/tmp`
3. Convert fetched files to markdown via docling (when applicable)
4. Invoke `skill({ name: "graphify" })` to extract a knowledge graph into a per-run temp directory
5. Delegate graph merge and entity writes to `skill({ name: "preserve" })`
6. Clean up temporary files

You do NOT classify entities, create vault files, write to the vault directly, or merge graph state.
All extraction is done by `skill({ name: "graphify" })`. All writes (including the graphify-output merge into the
vault's cumulative `graphify-out/`) are done by `skill({ name: "preserve" })`.

Follow the phases below in order, without skipping steps.

---

## Phase 0 — Ensure docling is installed

Before any fetch or conversion, verify that the `docling` CLI is available. If missing, install
it silently using the same fallback chain `skill({ name: "setup" })` uses for graphify, emitting a single
status line before proceeding.

```bash
if command -v docling >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Phase 0: docling already installed — proceeding."
else
  echo "Phase 0: docling not found — installing silently (one-time setup, may take a few minutes for model download)."
  # Step 1 — pipx (preferred, isolated)
  if command -v pipx >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    pipx install docling >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  fi
  # Step 2 — pip (fallback if pipx unavailable or failed)
  if ! command -v docling >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    if command -v pip3 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      pip3 install --user docling >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    elif command -v pip >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      pip install --user docling >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    fi
  fi
  # Final re-probe
  if ! command -v docling >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "ERROR: docling install failed. Run skill({ name: "setup" }) to install it, or install manually: pipx install docling"
    exit 1
  fi
  echo "Phase 0: docling installed."
fi
```

**Failure mode:** If install fails (no `pipx`/`pip`, network outage, permission denied), abort
the skill with the error above. Do NOT fetch or mutate anything. Direct the user to `skill({ name: "setup" })`.

**No user prompt:** this step is silent — one status line on success, one error line on failure.

---

## Phase 1 — Fetch

### 1.1 Classify the input

The user provides an argument. Classify it in the following priority order. URL-type routing
is unchanged; local files no longer have an extension allowlist — any existing file is accepted,
and Phase 1.5 decides whether to run docling on it.

| Input | Detected type | Fetch method |
|---|---|---|
| URL containing `confluence` or `atlassian.net` | confluence | Read `skills/confluence-to-markdown/SKILL.md`, follow instructions, save output to tmp |
| URL containing `docs.google.com` | gdoc | Read `skills/gdoc-to-markdown/SKILL.md`, follow instructions, save output to tmp |
| URL containing `github.com` | github-repo | `git clone --depth 1` to tmp + GitHub MCP enrichment (docling never runs on GitHub repos) |
| URL starting with `http://` or `https://` (any other) | remote-binary | Download raw bytes to tmp via `curl`/WebFetch; Phase 1.5 decides conversion |
| Local file path (any existing file) | local-file | Copy to tmp; Phase 1.5 decides conversion |
| Local directory path | local-dir | Copy directory to tmp |
| No match above | manual | Ask the user: "Could not identify the source type. Paste the content or provide a valid URL/path." |

If no argument was provided: ask the user "What source do you want to ingest? Provide a URL (Confluence, Google Docs, GitHub, or any HTTP(S) URL) or a local file path (any file type — docling will convert it to markdown if supported)."

### 1.2 Create temporary directory

All content is fetched to a temporary directory. This is the single input path for `skill({ name: "graphify" })`.

```bash
TEACH_TMP="/tmp/bedrock-teach-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$TEACH_TMP"
echo "Temporary directory: $TEACH_TMP"
```

Store the path for use in subsequent phases.

### 1.3 Fetch content

Execute the fetch strategy for the detected type. All content lands in `$TEACH_TMP/`.

#### 1.3.1 GitHub repository

For GitHub URLs (e.g.: `https://github.com/acme-corp/billing-api`):

1. Extract `owner/repo` and `repo-name` from the URL
2. Clone the repository (shallow):
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 <url> "$TEACH_TMP/<repo-name>"
   ```
3. GitHub MCP enrichment — call directly in main context (NOT via subagent — MCP permissions are not inherited):
   - `github_get_file_contents` → read the repo's README.md
   - `github_list_commits` → last 10 commits
   - `github_list_pull_requests` → last 5 PRs (state=all, sort=updated)
4. Compile MCP results into a single markdown file and save as `$TEACH_TMP/<repo-name>/_github_metadata.md`

> **Best-effort:** If any MCP call fails, continue with what was obtained. Do NOT block ingestion.

#### 1.3.2 Confluence

For Confluence URLs:
1. Read the internal skill at `<base_dir>/../confluence-to-markdown/SKILL.md`
2. Follow its instructions to parse the URL, choose layer (MCP → API → browser), and extract content
3. Save the returned Markdown content to `$TEACH_TMP/<slug>.md`
   - `<slug>` is derived from the page title or URL path (kebab-case, lowercase)

If all three layers (MCP, API, browser) are unavailable: warn the user with the guidance message from the fetcher module and abort this source type.

#### 1.3.3 Google Docs / Sheets

For Google Docs or Sheets URLs:
1. Read the internal skill at `<base_dir>/../gdoc-to-markdown/SKILL.md`
2. Follow its instructions to parse the URL, detect document type (Doc vs Sheet), choose layer (MCP → API/public export → browser), and extract content
3. The fetcher saves output to `/tmp/gdoc_{docId}.md` or `/tmp/gsheet_{docId}.md`
4. Copy the output file to `$TEACH_TMP/<slug>.md`
   - `<slug>` is derived from the document title or URL path (kebab-case, lowercase)

If all three layers (MCP, API/public export, browser) are unavailable: warn the user with the guidance message from the fetcher module and abort this source type.

#### 1.3.4 Remote URL (generic)

For any other HTTP/HTTPS URL, download the raw bytes so docling can operate on binary formats
(PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, images, etc.) that WebFetch cannot return faithfully as text:

1. Try `curl` first for true binary fidelity:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL -o "$TEACH_TMP/<filename-derived-from-url>" "<url>"
   ```
   - `<filename-derived-from-url>` preserves the URL's basename (including extension) when
     available; fall back to `<slug>.bin` if no extension is present.
2. If `curl` is unavailable or the URL returns an HTML page (by Content-Type), fall back to
   WebFetch and save the response text as `$TEACH_TMP/<slug>.md`.

If both attempts fail: warn "Could not fetch URL. Check if the URL is accessible." and abort.

Phase 1.5 decides whether the downloaded file goes through docling, based on the file extension.

#### 1.3.5 Local file (any format)

For local files:
1. Verify the file exists using Read (or `test -f`).
2. Copy to tmp preserving the filename:
   ```bash
   cp "<local-path>" "$TEACH_TMP/"
   ```

No extension-based filtering — any existing file is accepted. Phase 1.5 decides conversion.

#### 1.3.6 Local directory

For local directories:
1. Verify the directory exists
2. Copy to tmp (excluding heavy directories):
   ```bash
   rsync -a --exclude='.git' --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='bin' --exclude='obj' \
     --exclude='.vs' --exclude='TestResults' --exclude='packages' \
     "<local-dir>/" "$TEACH_TMP/$(basename <local-dir>)/"
   ```

### 1.4 Phase 1 result

At the end of this phase, you should have:
- **`$TEACH_TMP`**: directory with all fetched content (local path for graphify)
- **`source_url`**: original URL or file path provided by the user
- **`source_type`**: `confluence`, `gdoc`, `github-repo`, `remote-binary`, `local-file`, `local-dir`, or `manual`

Report: "Phase 1 complete: Content fetched to `$TEACH_TMP`. Source type: `<source_type>`."

---

## Phase 1.5 — Docling Conversion

For every fetched file in `$TEACH_TMP` that is not a GitHub repo and is not already markdown
output from Confluence/GDoc fetchers, check whether docling supports the file type and, if so,
convert it to markdown in place. GitHub repos (`source_type == "github-repo"`) skip this phase
entirely and flow straight to graphify.

### 1.5.1 Docling-supported extensions

Docling supports conversion for the following file types (as of the version installed by
Phase 0 / `skill({ name: "setup" })`). Compare by lowercase file extension:

```
.pdf .docx .pptx .xlsx
.html .htm
.md .adoc
.png .jpg .jpeg .tiff .bmp
.epub
```

- `.md` is listed here because docling passes markdown through largely unchanged. In practice,
  running docling on `.md` is a no-op we skip to save time — treat `.md` as already-markdown.
- `.txt` and `.csv` are NOT in docling's supported list (they are plain-text already); skip
  docling and pass through raw.

### 1.5.2 Routing and failure rules

For each file under `$TEACH_TMP` (excluding files inside `<repo-name>/` subdirectories of a
`github-repo` source — skip those entirely):

1. **Skip by type — already markdown or plain text:** if extension is `.md`, `.txt`, or `.csv`,
   leave the file untouched and record status `passed-through` for the report. Graphify handles
   these natively.

2. **Skip by routing — not docling-supported:** if the extension is not in the supported list
   above AND is not `.md`/`.txt`/`.csv`, leave the file untouched and record status
   `passed-through` with a note `(type not supported by docling)`. Graphify decides what to do
   with the raw file.

3. **Run docling:** otherwise, invoke docling and replace the source file with the converted
   markdown. Docling writes to the working directory by default; use `--to md` and `--output`
   to target a predictable path:

   ```bash
   cd "$TEACH_TMP"
   docling --from <auto> --to md --output "$TEACH_TMP" "<relative-file-path>"
   ```

   Docling produces `<stem>.md` alongside the source. After a successful run:
   - Remove the original binary: `rm "<relative-file-path>"`.
   - Record status `converted` for the report with the new markdown filename.

4. **Failure fallback:** if docling exits non-zero for a file:
   - If the source file's extension is `.md`, `.txt`, or `.csv` (already handled by rule 1,
     so this branch is defensive): leave the original file in place, record status
     `failed-fallback (raw passthrough)`, and continue with other files.
   - Otherwise (binary format like `.docx`, `.pdf`, etc.): **abort the entire skill**. Clean
     up `$TEACH_TMP` (`rm -rf "$TEACH_TMP"`) and emit a clear error:
     `ERROR: docling failed to convert <file>. Aborting ingestion. Temp directory cleaned up.`
     Do NOT proceed to graphify or preserve.

### 1.5.3 Phase 1.5 result

At the end of Phase 1.5:
- `$TEACH_TMP` contains markdown files (either originals or docling-converted).
- You have a per-file status map to surface in Phase 4's report:
  - `converted`: ran docling successfully
  - `passed-through`: skipped docling (markdown/plain text or unsupported type)
  - `failed-fallback`: docling failed but file was text-native; continued with raw file

Report: "Phase 1.5 complete: N converted, M passed-through, P failed-fallback."

---

## Phase 2 — Extract

### 2.1 Invoke skill({ name: "graphify" }) into a per-run temp directory

Use the Skill tool to invoke `skill({ name: "graphify" })`, directing its output to a per-run temp directory
(**not** the vault). The vault's cumulative `graphify-out/` is updated by `skill({ name: "preserve" })`'s
Phase 0 merge step, not by this skill.

```
skill({ name: "graphify" }) $TEACH_TMP --mode deep --obsidian --obsidian-dir $TEACH_TMP
```

The convention used here: passing `--obsidian-dir $TEACH_TMP` makes graphify write its
`graphify-out/` tree under `$TEACH_TMP/graphify-out/`. Store that path as:

```bash
GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW="$TEACH_TMP/graphify-out"
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Invoke via the Skill tool — never call graphify Python API directly.
- `skill({ name: "graphify" })` runs its full pipeline: detect → extract (AST + semantic) → build → cluster → analyze → obsidian export.
- Output lands in `$GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW`, which is inside the temp directory. The vault's
  `<VAULT_PATH>/graphify-out/` is NOT touched by this skill — `skill({ name: "preserve" })` owns that write.

### 2.2 Verify output

After `skill({ name: "graphify" })` completes, verify the output in the temp location:

```bash
if [ -f "$GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW/graph.json" ] && [ -s "$GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW/graph.json" ]; then
    echo "graphify output verified: graph.json exists and is non-empty"
else
    echo "ERROR: $GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW/graph.json is missing or empty"
fi
```

**If graph.json is missing or empty:**
- Warn the user: "graphify extraction failed — no graph produced. Check the content and try again."
- Clean up tmp: `rm -rf "$TEACH_TMP"`
- Abort gracefully

### 2.3 Phase 2 result

The following files should exist in `$GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW`:
- `graph.json` — knowledge graph (nodes, edges, communities)
- `GRAPH_REPORT.md` — audit report with god nodes, surprising connections
- `obsidian/*.md` — one markdown file per node
- `.graphify_analysis.json` — communities, cohesion scores, god nodes

Report: "Phase 2 complete: graphify extraction finished in `$GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW`. Graph: N nodes, M edges. Will be merged into the vault by skill({ name: "preserve" })."

---

## Phase 3 — Delegate to skill({ name: "preserve" })

### 3.1 Compile input for /preserve

Pass the **temp** graphify output path and provenance metadata to `skill({ name: "preserve" })`. The
skill's Phase 0.2 merges this temp output into the vault's cumulative `graphify-out/`:

```
graphify_output_path: $GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW       # = $TEACH_TMP/graphify-out/
source_url: <source_url from Phase 1>
source_type: <source_type from Phase 1>
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- `/teach` does NOT classify graphify nodes into entity types. Entity classification, filtering,
  matching, and user confirmation are all `skill({ name: "preserve" })`'s responsibility (Phase 1.3).
- `/teach` does NOT merge the graph into the vault. That is `skill({ name: "preserve" })`'s responsibility
  (Phase 0.2). We pass the per-run temp path; preserve merges and then reads from the merged
  `<VAULT_PATH>/graphify-out/`.

### 3.2 Invoke /preserve

Use the Skill tool to invoke `skill({ name: "preserve" }) --vault <VAULT_NAME>` passing the graphify
output reference (pointing at `$GRAPHIFY_OUT_NEW`) and provenance metadata as the argument.
The `--vault <VAULT_NAME>` flag ensures preserve writes to the same vault.

### 3.3 Receive result

`skill({ name: "preserve" })` returns:
- List of entities created/updated
- Commit hash (if there was a commit)
- **`graphify_merge` block:** `{nodes_added, nodes_merged, edges_added, stale_flag_set}` from
  preserve's Phase 0.2 merge
- Any errors or warnings

Record the result for use in the report (Phase 4).

---

## Phase 4 — Cleanup and Report

### 4.1 Cleanup temporary directory

After `skill({ name: "preserve" })` confirms completion, remove the temporary directory:

```bash
rm -rf "$TEACH_TMP"
echo "Temporary directory cleaned up: $TEACH_TMP"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Clean up AFTER /preserve confirms, not after graphify finishes.
The graphify output in `graphify-out/` is NOT cleaned up — it lives in the vault
and is used by `skill({ name: "ask" })` for graph traversal.

### 4.2 Report

Present to the user:

```
## bedrock-teach — Report

### Ingested source
- **Type:** <source_type>
- **URL/Path:** <source_url>

---

## Critical Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Invoke skill({ name: "graphify" }) via Skill tool | NEVER call graphify Python API directly (`graphify.detect`, `graphify.build`, `graphify.extract`, etc.). Always invoke via the Skill tool. |
| All remote content fetched to /tmp | Every input type is fetched to `/tmp/bedrock-teach-<ts>/` before invoking graphify. graphify receives only a local path. |
| /teach does NOT classify entities | Entity classification, filtering, matching, and user confirmation are `skill({ name: "preserve" })`'s responsibility. /teach passes the graphify output path and provenance metadata. |
| Delegate to skill({ name: "preserve" }) | ALL entities are persisted via `skill({ name: "preserve" })` — teach does NOT create, update, or write vault entities. |
| /teach does NOT merge graphify output into the vault | Graphify is invoked into `$TEACH_TMP/graphify-out/` (per-run temp dir); `skill({ name: "preserve" })`'s Phase 0.2 merges that into `<VAULT_PATH>/graphify-out/`. /teach never writes directly to the vault's `graphify-out/`. |
| Docling auto-install is silent | Phase 0 auto-installs docling if missing with a single status line — no user prompt. Fail the skill if install fails; direct the user to `skill({ name: "setup" })`. |
| Docling skipped for GitHub repos | `source_type == "github-repo"` skips Phase 1.5 entirely — cloned repos flow straight to graphify. |
| Docling routing rule | Run docling on files with docling-supported extensions (see Phase 1.5.1). Pass-through for `.md`/`.txt`/`.csv` and for extensions not in docling's supported list. |
| Docling failure fallback | On docling non-zero exit: if file is `.md`/`.txt`/`.csv`, continue with raw file. For any other extension, abort the entire skill and clean up `$TEACH_TMP`. |
| Cleanup /tmp after /preserve confirms | Remove `/tmp/bedrock-teach-<ts>/` only after /preserve confirms completion, not after graphify finishes. |
| Provenance via source_url | ALWAYS include `source_url` and `source_type` when delegating to skill({ name: "preserve" }). |
| Internal fetcher skills | Read internal skills from `<base_dir>/../confluence-to-markdown/SKILL.md` and `<base_dir>/../gdoc-to-markdown/SKILL.md` for content fetching. Never invoke external skills. |
| Best-effort for external sources | If MCP or fetch fails, warn and continue with what was obtained. Never block ingestion. |
| MCP in main context | Do NOT use subagents for GitHub/Atlassian MCP calls — permissions are not inherited. |
| Maximum 2 push attempts | After that, abort and inform (handled by /preserve). |
| Sensitive data | NEVER include credentials, tokens, passwords, PANs, CVVs. |
| Vault resolution first | Resolve `VAULT_PATH` before any file operation — never assume CWD is the vault |
| Pass --vault to /preserve | ALWAYS include `--vault <VAULT_NAME>` when delegating to `skill({ name: "preserve" })` |
